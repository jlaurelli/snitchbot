SnitchBot - Tweet Your Code Comments
====================================

A probably-overengineered script that scans a Python file, searches for 
commented code, and wraps each segment into tweets. Good for oh-so-hilarious
times when ITAR-restricted content gets inadvertently released to the public.

If you have not figured it out already, this script can be exceedingly
dangerous depending on the contents of the file fed to it. These dangers can
lead to loss of job, career, life, and worst of all, respect in the Hacker News
community. Please use this intelligently (by not using at all).
