Snitchbot - Turn Your Comments Into Tweets
==========================================

A script that scans a python file, searches for commented code, and wraps each
segment into tweets. Good for oh-so-hilarious times when ITAR-restricted
content gets inadvertently released to the public.

If you have not figured it out already, this script can be exceedingly
dangerous depending on the contents of the file fed to it. These dangers can
lead to loss of job, career, life, and worst of all, respect in the HN
community. Please use intelligently by not using this at all.

Requires a 'keys.py' module to hold the keys.

NOTE: Other languages that use hashes to denote single-line comments (Ruby,
Perl, etc.) may also work to limited capacity if the file-type check is
removed.
